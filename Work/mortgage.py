# Exercise 1.7

# Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with
# Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. The
# interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11.

    total_paid = total_paid + monthly_payment

# Exercise 1.8 Extra Payments
# Suppose Dave pays an extra $1000/month for the first 12 months of the mortgage?
# Modify the program to incorporate this extra payment and have it print the total
# amount paid along with the number of months required. When you run the new program,
# it should report a total payment of 929,965.62 over 342 months.

# Exercise 1.9 Extra Payments Calculator
# Modify the program so that extra payment information can be more generally 
# handled. Make it so that the user can set these variables:
# extra_payment_start_month = 61
# extra_payment_end_month = 108
# extra_payment = 1000
